# Movie Recommender System README

This repository contains a movie recommender system built using collaborative filtering techniques and vector space embedding. The system suggests movies based on user preferences by employing cosine similarity on a dataset of movies.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: The recommender system uses collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences.
- **Vector Space Embedding**: Movies are represented in a vector space, allowing for efficient comparison and recommendation.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Cosine similarity is employed to determine the similarity between movies and recommend those most closely related to the user's preferences.
- **Streamlit Integration**: The recommender system is integrated into a Streamlit application, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the movie recommender system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**: Launch the Streamlit application by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. **Interact with the Application**: Access the application through your web browser and explore movie recommendations based on your preferences.

## Usage

- Upon launching the Streamlit application, users will be presented with an interface to input their movie preferences.
- Users can specify movies they have enjoyed in the past or provide characteristics of movies they typically prefer.
- Based on the provided input, the recommender system will suggest similar movies using collaborative filtering and vector space embedding techniques.
- Users can explore the recommended movies and select options for further details or additional recommendations.
